## Development

> [!WARNING]
> This section is intended for experienced/enthusiasts developers comfortable with full-stack JavaScript projects.

Setting up a local development environment is easy, for now.

Clone (or fork) this repo on your machine, navigate to its location in the terminal and follow the steps below.

### Manual Setup

Setup by hand, if something breaks or it's not working properly **it's on you**.

#### Install dependencies

```sh
pnpm install
```

#### Setup Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file at the project's root directory. Refer to the [environment variables](#environment-variables) section to read the full specifications.

#### Initialize Prisma

Run Prisma migrations to initialize the database:

```sh
pnpm prisma migrate dev
```

Then, generate a Prisma client to handle queries:

```sh
pnpm prisma generate --no-engine
```

#### Run the development server

```sh
pnpm run dev
```

This will initialize all packages in parallel and watch for changes, including the website which will be available at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Environment variables

To deploy the project you need to set the following environment variables:

- `DATABASE_URL`: **Required**. Sets the URL where Prisma it's going to fetch/query data from. Get yours at <https://prisma.io>
